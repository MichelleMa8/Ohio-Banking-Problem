# ISE533-Ohio Banking Problem

## Project Background:
Prior to 1979, banks in Ohio were only allowed to place branches in a county where the bank had a principal place of business. A new law in 1979 allowed banks to put branches in any county where the bank has a principal place of business and in any county adjacent to one in which it has a principal place of business. The question posed is, What is the minimum number of principal places of business, and in which counties should they be located to enable branches in all eighty-eight counties of Ohio?

The model for this problem is a classic set cover problem where the constraints ensure that for each of the 88 counties, the county has a principal place of business or a county adjacent to it has a principal place of business.
